                    And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], <br>their father said, "<strong>I sense the scent of Yusuf</strong>, if you do not find me deluded." 
                </p>

                <p>
                    They replied, "By Allah! indeed you are in your old delusion."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus when the <strong>bearer of good tidings</strong> arrived, he cast it over his face so he regained his sight.<br>
                    He said "Did I not say to you that I know from Allah that which you do not know?"
                </p>
