                    And we have not sent before them except men from the townships. <br>
                    Do they not travel through the land to see what was the end of those before them?<br>
                    <strong>And the Home of the End is better for those mindful [of Allah]</strong>. Thus will you not reason?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Until, when the messengers despaired and were certain they had been denied, <br>
                    there came to them victory, and whoever We willed was saved.<br>
                    And Our punishment cannot be averted by the wicked people
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Verily in their stories there is a lesson for people of reason.</strong> <br>
                    This story is not a fabrication and rather a confirmation of what has occurred<br>
                    and a <strong>detailed explanation of All things</strong> <br>
                    and <strong>guidance and mercy</strong> for people that believe.
