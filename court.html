                    Yusuf said "She attempted to seduce my soul"<br>
                    and a witness from her family testified "If his shirt is torn from the front then she is truthful and he is a liar.<br>
                    And if his shirt is torn from the back then <strong>she has lied and he is of the truthful.</strong>"
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So when the Husband saw Yusuf's shirt torn from the back, he said "This is from your plan, indeed your plan is evident.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yusuf ignore this, and <strong>she must seek forgiveness for the sin</strong>. Indeed you were of the wrongdoers."
