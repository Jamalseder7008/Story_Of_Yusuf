                    So when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father, they have restricted further supplies, so send with us our brother so that we may receive more and <strong>we will be protective of him</strong>."

                <p> 
                    He said, "<strong>Should I entrust you with him as I once entrusted you with his brother before?</strong> Thus Allah is the best protector and he is the Most Merciful of the merciful." 
                </p>

                <p>
                    He said, "Never, will I send him with you <br>
                    until you give me a oath by Allah that you will bring him to me <br>
                    unless you are completely overpowered." <br>
                    Once they had given him their oaths, he said, "Allah is mindful to what we have said."
