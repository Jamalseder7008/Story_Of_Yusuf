                    They said "Yusuf and his brother are more loved than us by our father and we are a strong group. Indeed our father is in clear error.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kill Yusuf or cast him out to a distant land so that your father's attention will be yours and you will be after this <strong>a group of righteous people</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the speakers of them said, "<strong>Do not kill Yusuf</strong> and rather throw him in the bottom of the well so the caravan will pick him up."
