                    And the women in the city said, "The wife of al-Azeez is trying to seduce her slave boy; he has her in love.<br>
                    Indeed we see her in clear delusion."

                    So when she heard them, she invited them to a banquet and she gave each of them a knife, and she told Yusuf "Come out before them."<br>
                    So when they saw him, as they were admiring his beauty they cut their hands, and we said "Perfect is Allah, this is not a man; indeed this is none but a noble angel."
