                    And there came a caravan and the water boy reached into the well to bring up a sip of water;<br> 
                    He said "Oh Good News, There is a child" so they hid him as merchandise and Allah is more knowing of what they do. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>They sold him</strong> for a reduced price. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The buyer from Egypt told his wife "Make his stay excellent, <strong>he may be a great use to us</strong> or we may take him as our own child."
