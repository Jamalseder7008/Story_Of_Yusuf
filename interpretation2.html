                    "Yusuf, <strong>O man of truth</strong>, Interpret for us the dream of seven fat cows eaten by seven lean ones, and seven bushels of greenery and others that are hard so that I may return to the people; perhaps they will learn."
                </p>

                <p>
                    He said "You will plant for seven years; and what you harvest put it in bushels, and eat a little of it.<br>
                    Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you have saved except the little you store for seed.<br>
                    Then will come after that a year which the people will be given abundant rain and they will press[fruits and vegetables]"
