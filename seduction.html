                    And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said "You Come". <br>
                    He said "It is Time, Allah is my Lord, he has made my stay excellent, <br>
                    <strong>indeed he will not let the wrongdoers succeed.</strong>" 
                </p>

                <p>
                    She desired him and he would have certainly desired her if he had not seen the proof of his Lord. <br>
                    <strong>Thus do we avert the lust and indecency from our excellent subjects.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And he raced to the door and she tore his shirt from the back, and she found her husband at the door; <br>
                    She said, "What is penalty for someone who intended lust for your family/wife, except imprisonment or a painful punishment."
