                    And Yusuf's brothers came and entered his presence. <br>
                    <strong>He recognized them but they were unaware of who he really was</strong>.

                <p>
                    And when he prepared their supplies, he said "Bring me your brother of yours from your father's side, do you not see that I give you enough and I am the best of accomadators?
                </p>

                <p>
                    But if you do not bring him to me, then I will not have enough[grain] for you, nor will you approach me."
                </p>

                <p>
                    They said "We will convince his father and we guarantee it."
