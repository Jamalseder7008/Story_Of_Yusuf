                    You worship not besides Him except names you have named them, you and your fathers.<br>
                    There is no proof or evidence that has been sent down regarding them.<br>
                    Wisdom is for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him.<br>
                    <strong>That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.</strong>"
