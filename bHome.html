                    Yaqoob said "No! Your souls have enticed you to something so <strong>patience is most fitting</strong>. Perhaps Allah will bring them to me all together.<br> 
                    Indeed it is He who is the All-Knowing, All-Wise."
                </p>

                <p>
                    They said, "By Allah, you will not cease remembering Yusuf until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish."
                </p>

                <p>
                    He said, "<strong>I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah</strong>, and I know from Allah that which you do not know.
                </p>

                <p>
                    O my sons! Go search for Yusuf and his brother, and <strong>do not despair of the spirit of Allah</strong>. Indeed no one loses hope in the spirit of Allah except the disbelieving group."
