                    They said "so what is the punishment, if you are liars?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    The brothers said "the punishment will be 'the enslavement of' the one in whose bag it is found, thus is <strong>the punishment of the wrongdoers</strong>."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Joseph began searching their bags before that of his brother's <br>
                    Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. This is how we inspired Yusuf to plan.<br>
                    He could not have taken his brother within the the king's religion, except that Allah willed. <br>
                    We raise in degrees whom we will, but <strong>over every possessor of knowledge there is one more knowing</strong>.
