                    The Brothers returned to their father weeping, "Our father, we went racing and left Yusuf with our belongings, and a wolf ate him.<br>
                    And you would not believe us even if we were truthful.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And they brought upon his shirt false blood. He said "No, your souls have enticed you to a command so <strong>patience is most fitting for us</strong>. <br> 
                    And <strong>Allah is the helper</strong> about that which you claim."
