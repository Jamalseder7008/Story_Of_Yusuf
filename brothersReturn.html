                    And when they entered Yusuf's presence, he called his brother to his side. <br>
                    He said <strong>"I am your brother so do not despair over what they used to do."</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So when he had furnished them with their goods, he put the grail(cup) in his brother's bag <br>
                    Then a caller from among them said "O people of the caravan, indeed you are thieves!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    They asked, turning around "What is it you are searching for?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    They said, "We are looking for the grail of the king, and he who finds it gets a camel's load of supplies. And I am responsible for it."
