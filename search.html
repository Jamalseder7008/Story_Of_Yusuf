                    So when they entered Yusuf's presence, they said, "O Leader, We and our family have been touched with hardship<br>
                    And We have come with salvaged goods, please give us enough supplies and <strong>be charitable to us. Indeed Allah rewards the charitable.</strong>"
                </p>

                <p>
                    He said "Do you know what you did with Yusuf and his brother in your ignorance?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    They said "Are you really Yusuf?!" <br>
                    He said "I am Yusuf and this is my brother! <br>
                    <strong>Allah has certainly been gracious to us.</strong> Surely whoever is mindful of Allah and is patient, then certainly <strong>Allah will not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.</strong>"
