                    And the King said "Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself." And when the King spoke to Yusuf he said "Indeed, you are today established in a position and trusted." 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Yusuf said "Declare me in charge of the storehouses of the land, <strong>I am protective and conscious.</strong>"
                </p>

                <p>
                    And thus we established Yusuf in the land to settle wherever he willed. We touch with Our Mercy whom we will, and we <strong>do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good</strong>.<br>
                    And the reward of <strong>the Hereafter is better</strong> for those who believed and were conscious of their relationship with God.
