                    And there entered the prison with him two men. <br>One of them said, "Indeed, I have seen myself pressing wine" <br>
                    and the other said "Indeed I see myself carrying bread on my head, from which the birds were eating."

                <p>
                    "Inform us of its interpretation; <strong>indeed we see you as one of those who do good deeds</strong>."

                <p>
                    Yusuf said "I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Yaqoob. <br>
                    <strong>And it is not for us to associate partners with Allah.</strong><br> 
                    <strong>This is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon the people</strong>, but <strong>most people are not grateful</strong>."
