                    They said "If he steals, then his previous brother had stolen." <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    ...

                <p>
                    They said "Oh Leader, indeed he has a father who is an old man, so take one of us in place of him. <br> 
                    <strong>Indeed we see you as a doer of good.</strong>"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yusuf said "Allah has not chosen that we should take anyone except him, indeed we would then be unjust."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Return to your Father then say "O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we do not testify except to what we knew. <br>
                    <strong>And we could not protect against the unseen.</strong>"
                </p>
